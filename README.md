# ThesisCode

Code for all the methods built throughout my Thesis.

Code is split into 3 types: The Finite Difference Volume Methods (FDVM), the Finite Difference Methods (FDM) and the Finite Element Volume Methods (FEVM).


The Finite Difference Volume Methods are described in the paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0307904X17302548
An additional third-order PPM scheme is also here, and has previously not been described, but is very similar to the other third order method, with a different reconstruction. 

The Finite Difference Methods are described in the paper : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165212517301324

The Finite Element Volume Method is described in the thesis (Which is also included in the repository)

A superior alternative to the FEVM in the thesis will be described in a paper that is about to be submitted and will be on archive shortly.
